## How can I contribute to Folktale?

Here are some ways in which you can contribute to the Folktale community:

  - Join the [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/folktale/discussion) and ask and/or answer questions. Folktale
    aims to be usable by people new to FP, so by asking questions and sharing
    your troubles with the library, you're helping us get closer to that goal.

  - Talk about Folktale. By bloggging, writing tutorials, or giving talks in
    your local JS community. A bigger and healthy community helps by really
    putting the libraries to test.

  - [Report bugs](#reporting-bugs) in our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/origamitower/folktale/issues), or
    [request new features](#requesting-features).

  - [Submit patches](#adding-or-fixing-code) for new features, or to fix existing
    bugs. Take a look at the list of [Good First Issues](https://waffle.io/origamitower/folktale?label=e:Good%20First%20Issue)
    if you're not entirely sure where to start.

  - [Improve existing documentation](#adding-or-fixing-documentation).


## Reporting bugs

Sometimes things don’t work as well as they should, or we can’t make them work the way we want, and we get frustrated by that. Both of those are situations were we encourage you to open an issue in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/origamitower/folktale/issues) so we can help you. Read the [Bug Reporting guide](http://folktale.origamitower.com/docs/support/bugs/) for more details.


## Requesting features

Folktale doesn’t do everything, so more often than not you’ll find something that you wish Folktale supported but that isn’t implemented yet. Maybe the thought has never crossed our minds. This is a great opportunity to [tell us about that feature you want](http://folktale.origamitower.com/docs/support/feature-request/).


## Adding or fixing tests

Folktale uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and
[JSVerify](https://github.com/jsverify/jsverify) for tests. Read the [Test Writing guide](http://folktale.origamitower.com/docs/v2.0.0/contributing/tests/) to understand how to add new tests, or update existing ones.


## Adding or fixing documentation

Found a typo in the documentation, or think that something is missing from it, and want to help fixing that? [Read the Documentation Writing guide](http://folktale.origamitower.com/docs/v2.0.0/contributing/documentation/) to understand how.


## Contributing bugfixes

While we do our best to write correct software, sometimes bugs will escape our tests and creep in. We really appreciate any contribution to fix these issues. Read the [Bug Fixing guide](http://folktale.origamitower.com/docs/v2.0.0/contributing/bugfixes/) to understand how to contribute.


## Adding new features

Folktale has a [roadmap](https://github.com/origamitower/folktale/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) which summarises the vision for the future of the library. Points in this roadmap are broken down into features, and detailed on the issue tracker as a feature proposal. The [Contributing Features guide](http://folktale.origamitower.com/docs/v2.0.0/contributing/new-features/) describes the process of contributing a new feature to Folktale.

> **Important**
> If a feature is not in the roadmap, please [submit a feature request](http://folktale.origamitower.com/docs/support/feature-request/) explaining why it should be added before you start to work on it.
